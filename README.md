To hold the commands etc to test OTRS Ticket#2018091917000063


Good morning, Robin, 
  
How are things going on this case? I donâ€™t actually have access to \BWNS02, but I know git is installed there. 
  
The command to reproduce requires an SSH logon at github.com, so that has to be set up first (log in, go to settings, add your SSH public key footprint generated by NonStop SSH. Must be min 2048 RSA). 
export GIT_SSH_COMMAND="/G/system/zssh/sshoss -Q"
git clone git@github.com:aquynh/capstone.git
  
That should do it. The clone will proceed but eventually hang. Removing GIT_SSH_COMMAND reverts to OpenSSH, which should work fine. 
  
Regards, 
Randall
