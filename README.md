To hold the commands etc to test OTRS Ticket#2018091917000063


Good morning, Robin, 
  
How are things going on this case? I donâ€™t actually have access to \BWNS02, but I know git is installed there. 
  
The command to reproduce requires an SSH logon at github.com, so that has to be set up first (log in, go to settings, add your SSH public key footprint generated by NonStop SSH. Must be min 2048 RSA). 
export GIT_SSH_COMMAND="/G/system/zssh/sshoss -Q"
git clone git@github.com:aquynh/capstone.git
  
That should do it. The clone will proceed but eventually hang. Removing GIT_SSH_COMMAND reverts to OpenSSH, which should work fine.

20Sep18:
Randall and Robinhad a Skype session where Robin shared his screen.
We ran an OSS session on \BWNS02 by entering "OSH" to the TACL prompt but discovered I need an OSS Home Directory before we can test.
Hence I asked Steve and Gus if they could set that up for me, since it requires and Admin with Safeguard credentials to set up.
